# 🎓 Machine Learning [Student Exam Score Predictor]

This project predicts **final exam scores** of students based on their **study hours** using **Linear Regression** (scikit-learn).  
It also evaluates model performance with **MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² metrics** and provides visualizations of the results.

## 📊 Features
- Load and preprocess student dataset (`student_performance_dataset.csv`)
- Train a **Linear Regression model**
- Evaluate model with:
  - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
  - **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
  - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
  - **R² Score (Model Accuracy)**
- Visualize results:
  - Distribution of scores
  - Predicted vs. Actual exam scores
